Regression Models


Regression models are a class of machine learning algorithms used for predictive modeling tasks that involve a continuous dependent variable. Regression models can be trained using a variety of algorithms, including linear regression, polynomial regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and others.
To train a regression model in machine learning, we typically use a dataset with known values for both the independent and dependent variables. We split the dataset into a training set and a validation set to evaluate the model's performance. The training set is used to estimate the values of the coefficients that minimize the error between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data.
The choice of algorithm and the specific model parameters will depend on the nature of the data and the specific predictive task. For example, linear regression may be appropriate for datasets with a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, while decision trees or random forests may be more appropriate for datasets with complex, nonlinear relationships.
Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data by providing the values of the independent variables as input. The model will output a predicted value of the dependent variable based on its learned relationships between the input and output variables.
