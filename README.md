Association Rules


The association rules algorithm is a widely used tool in large companies to identify patterns in transactional data and create associations between items. By analyzing how certain items are commonly paired with others in a given transaction or basket, this algorithm can reveal valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. It is worth noting that the association rules algorithm is an unsupervised learning method, meaning that there is no predetermined outcome or desired output. Instead, the algorithm relies on the data to generate an estimated output, making it a powerful tool for discovering unexpected patterns and relationships in the data.
