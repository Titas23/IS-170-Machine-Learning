Decision Tree 


The decision tree algorithm is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into smaller and more homogeneous subsets based on the values of the input variables, ultimately creating a tree-like structure that can be used to make predictions on new data.
The decision tree algorithm is based on the concept of entropy, which measures the amount of impurity or uncertainty in a set of examples. The goal of the algorithm is to split the dataset in a way that minimizes the entropy of the resulting subsets. The split is chosen to maximize the information gain, which is the reduction in entropy achieved by splitting the data based on a particular input variable.
The decision tree algorithm starts with the entire dataset as the root node of the tree. At each node, the algorithm chooses the input variable that maximizes the information gain and creates a branch for each possible value of that input variable. The data is then split into subsets based on the selected variable, and the process is repeated recursively for each subset until a stopping criterion is met (such as a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of examples per leaf node).
Once the decision tree is constructed, it can be used to make predictions on new data by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node based on the values of the input variables. The predicted output is the majority class (for classification tasks) or the average value (for regression tasks) of the examples in the leaf node.
