K-Nearest Neighbors


The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, yet effective machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
In the classification setting, the KNN algorithm predicts the class of a new data point based on the classes of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. For instance, if we have a dataset with two classes "A" and "B" and a new data point is located near four data points of class "A" and one data point of class "B," then the KNN algorithm will classify the new point as "A."

In the regression setting, the KNN algorithm predicts the target value of a new data point based on the average of its k nearest neighbors' target values.
The KNN algorithm works by calculating the distance between the new data point and all the data points in the dataset. The most common distance metric used is Euclidean distance. Once the distances are calculated, the KNN algorithm selects the k nearest neighbors and returns the most common class label (in the classification setting) or the average of their target values (in the regression setting) as the predicted value.

One important parameter of the KNN algorithm is k, which determines the number of neighbors to consider. A higher value of k will result in a smoother decision boundary and less sensitivity to outliers, while a lower value of k will result in a more complex decision boundary and more sensitivity to outliers.
