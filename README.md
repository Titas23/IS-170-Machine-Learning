Principal Component Analysis


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to identify patterns and correlations within high-dimensional data sets. The PCA algorithm works by transforming the original data into a new set of variables known as principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables, where the weights of the combination are chosen such that the resulting component captures as much variance in the data as possible.

The first principal component is the linear combination of the original variables that captures the maximum amount of variance in the data. The second principal component is the next best linear combination that captures the maximum remaining variance, and so on. The number of principal components is typically chosen such that they account for a sufficiently large percentage of the total variance in the data.

By reducing the dimensionality of the data in this way, PCA can simplify complex data sets and enable us to visualize the relationships between variables more easily. Additionally, PCA can be used for data compression and feature extraction, making it a useful tool in machine learning and data analysis applications.
